## Title
Genetic Analysis of Wild Rice Population Using SNP Data

## Abstract
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a wild rice population using SNP data. The dataset consists of 446 samples with 13077 SNPs, which underwent quality control measures. The analyses included Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), genetic diversity calculations, genetic distance analysis, selection sweep detection, and core collection construction. Key findings highlight population structure, genetic diversity metrics, selection signatures, and core collection representativeness.

## 1. Introduction
