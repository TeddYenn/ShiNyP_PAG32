### Data Description:
The SNP dataset consists of 12833 SNPs derived from 446 samples of wild rice. Quality control procedures were applied, resulting in the removal of SNPs with missing rates > 0.05, minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.1, heterozygosity rate < 0, and heterozygosity rate > 0.1. 

The average SNP spacing is approximately 29084.82 bp, with an average of 0.0344 SNPs per 1000 bp, indicating the SNP density within the dataset.

### Population Structure:
#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
The top 15 principal components (PCs) explain variance ranging from 3.83% (PC1) to 0.41% (PC15). The 'elbow' point in the explained variance plot suggests that meaningful variation is captured up to PC4, beyond which the contribution decreases gradually.

#### Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC):
Based on BIC values, the samples were grouped into 7 distinct genetic clusters. The discriminant analysis revealed separations between these groups along the first and second discriminant functions, indicating genetic differentiation.

### Genetic Diversity:
The average missing rate, MAF, and nucleotide diversity (Ï€) across all chromosomes were 0%, 0.2425, and 0.3521, respectively. The expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.138 to 0.3619 across the 7 identified groups, with varying levels of genetic diversity within and between groups.

### Genetic Distance and Differentiation:
The genetic distance matrix revealed varying levels of differentiation between groups, with Fst estimates indicating substantial genetic structuring. The AMOVA results showed significant variance between groups (47.23%) and within individuals within groups (52.77%), highlighting population differentiation.

### Selection Sweep Analysis:
The pcadapt analysis identified 417 significant selection signatures across all chromosomes, indicating potential regions under selective pressure. In contrast, the OutFLANK analysis did not detect any significant selection signatures, suggesting different approaches may yield varying results.

### Core Collection Construction:
A core collection of 7 samples (1.57%) encompassing 1272 core SNPs (9.91%) was constructed, providing representation of genetic diversity while reducing redundancy. The core collection could serve as a valuable subset for conservation or breeding efforts.

### Conclusion:
The analysis of the wild rice SNP dataset revealed significant population structure, genetic diversity, genetic distance, and potential selection signatures. The core collection construction offers a practical approach to capturing essential genetic variations for further studies. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic landscape of wild rice populations and can inform conservation and breeding strategies.
