### Title
SNP Data Analysis of Wild Rice: Population Structure, Genetic Diversity, and Selection Signatures

### Abstract
This report presents an in-depth analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a wild rice dataset, comprising 446 samples with 13,077 initial variants. After rigorous quality control (QC), 12,833 SNPs were retained. The analysis employed methodologies such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), and selection sweep detection to understand the genetic diversity and population structure within the dataset. PCA identified significant variance across the top components, while DAPC clustering revealed seven distinct groups. Notable genetic diversity metrics included an average nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.3521 and a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.2425. Additionally, selection sweep analyses detected 417 significant selection signatures. The construction of a core collection comprising 7 samples provides a foundation for future research initiatives. This study underscores the importance of SNP analysis in elucidating genetic patterns that are vital for conservation and breeding efforts in wild rice.

### 1. Introduction
- **Background**: SNP analysis serves as a cornerstone in understanding the genetic makeup and population dynamics of species. In wild rice, SNPs provide insights into its evolutionary history, adaptation, and potential applications in agriculture and conservation.
  
- **Objectives**: The primary aims of this SNP analysis are to assess genetic diversity, delineate population structure, and identify selection signatures that may inform future breeding programs and conservation strategies.

### 2. Materials and Methods
- **SNP Dataset**: The study analyzes a wild rice SNP dataset, featuring 446 samples with an initial count of 13,077 SNPs.

- **Quality Control (QC)**: Quality control was performed to maintain data integrity; SNPs with a missing rate greater than 5%, minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.1, and heterozygosity rates outside the 0-0.1 range were excluded. Following QC, 12,833 SNPs remained for analysis.

- **Statistical and Computational Methods**: 
  - PCA was utilized to visualize genetic variance, with subsequent DAPC employed to assess population structuring.
  - Genetic diversity metrics and distances were calculated for both individual groups and the overall dataset.
  - Selection sweeps were detected using PCA-based and Fst-based genome scan methods, applying the Benjamini & Hochberg (FDR) method for significance adjustment. Software utilized included R and the ShiNyP platform.

### 3. Results

#### 3.1 SNP Data Description and Quality Control (QC)
The final dataset included 446 samples and 12,833 SNPs after QC processes. Key QC metrics noted that the average minor allele frequency was 0.2425, with a 0% missing rate.

#### 3.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA revealed that the first 15 principal components contributed to the variance as follows: 3.83%, 1.59%, 1.38%, 1.04%, 0.84%, 0.56%, 0.53%, 0.49%, 0.46%, 0.44%, 0.44%, 0.43%, 0.42%, 0.42%, and 0.41%. The elbow method indicated significant information beyond the first few components for further analyses.

#### 3.3 Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) Clustering
DAPC identified seven distinct population groups based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values at K = 7. The group sizes were 41, 54, 52, 79, 70, 70, and 80, with centroids defined for the first two discriminant functions.

#### 3.4 Genetic Diversity Statistics
The overall genetic diversity metrics demonstrated an average expected heterozygosity (He) for the groups as follows: Group 1 (0.3619), Group 2 (0.1416), Group 3 (0.2405), Group 4 (0.2297), Group 5 (0.1380), Group 6 (0.1961), and Group 7 (0.1394). The average nucleotide diversity (π) mirrored these trends, showcasing variability across groups.

#### 3.5 Genetic Distance and Differentiation Statistics
The genetic distance matrix revealed significant distances among groups, notably between Group 5 and Group 1 (0.320) and among other inter-group comparisons. AMOVA results indicated that 47.23% of the variance was attributed to differences among groups while 52.77% was due to individual variation within groups.

#### 3.6 Selection Sweep Analysis
PCA-based genome scans identified 417 significant selection signatures across 12 chromosomes. In contrast, the Fst-based approach detected no significant selection signatures.

#### 3.7 Core Collection Construction
A core collection was constructed comprising 7 samples (1.57% of the dataset), covering 99.74% of the SNP diversity, indicating a representative subset for future studies.

### 4. Discussion
- **Key Findings**: The analyses revealed distinct population structures within the wild rice samples, reflected in genetic diversity metrics, and potential adaptation signals exemplified by the selection sweep results.

- **Implications and Applications**: The findings have significant implications for conservation biology and agricultural breeding programs, potentially guiding genetic resource management and the development of new cultivars.

- **Limitations**: The analysis is constrained by the initial dataset's limitation in sample diversity and genomic coverage. Future research could benefit from incorporating additional SNP datasets and genomic technologies.

### 5. Conclusion
This study successfully elucidates the genetic landscape of wild rice through comprehensive SNP analysis, highlighting its utility in revealing population structures and selection signatures. The insights gained could inform future conservation efforts and breeding strategies aimed at enhancing genetic diversity within wild rice populations. Further research should expand upon these findings through additional datasets and complementary methodologies.
