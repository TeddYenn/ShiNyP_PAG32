### SNP Data Description

The SNP dataset consists of 446 wild rice samples and encompasses 12,833 SNPs, distributed across 12 chromosomes with a total genomic length of approximately 373 million base pairs. After applying quality control measures—such as removing SNPs with a missing rate greater than 0.05, a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.1, and with aberrant heterozygosity rates—12,833 high-quality SNPs were retained for further analysis. The average SNP density of 0.0344 SNPs per kilobase and a spacing of approximately 29,085 base pairs indicates a moderately dispersed SNP distribution suitable for genomic studies.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA for the wild rice dataset revealed that the top 15 principal components (PCs) explained variances as follows: PC1 contributed 3.83% and PC2 contributed 1.59%. Based on Cattell's rule, an observable elbow appears between PC1 and PC5, suggesting that the first four PCs capture the most critical variation in the dataset. This reduced dimension represents potential underlying population structures worth further examination.

### DAPC Clustering

The DAPC identified seven distinct genetic clusters among the samples using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to define the optimal number of groups. The group sizes showed variability, with Group 4 being the largest (79 samples) and Group 1 the smallest (41 samples). The distribution of centroids in discriminant space suggests clear separation among certain groups, although some overlap exists, indicating substantial within-group variability or shared ancestry.

### Genetic Diversity

The wild rice populations exhibit a moderate degree of genetic diversity, with the overall nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.3521 and expected heterozygosity varying across clusters. Notably, Group 1 displayed the highest genetic diversity (He = 0.3619, Pi = 0.371), while Group 5 presented as relatively less diverse (He = 0.138, Pi = 0.14). The absence of exclusive alleles and prevalence of fixed alleles across all groups indicate a pattern of shared polymorphisms and potential recent divergence between groups.

### Genetic Distance and Differentiation

Genetic distances between groups vary significantly, with Group 5 and Group 4 displaying the largest genetic differentiation, potentially reflecting distinct evolutionary paths or environmental adaptations. The AMOVA results (47.23% of variance among groups, p < 0.01) support significant genetic differentiation between groups, substantiating the presence of structured genetic variation, with additional variation existing within individuals.

### Selection Sweep Analysis

The pcadapt selection scan identified 417 SNP loci under selection pressure, comprehensively scanning the genome for adaptive variants using an FDR threshold of α = 0.01. However, the OutFLANK analysis, focusing on Fst differences, did not find evidence of selection, potentially highlighting the sensitivity of different methodologies in detecting selection signals. Regions with strong selection pressures might indicate loci associated with adaptive traits such as stress tolerance or disease resistance.

### Core Collection Construction

A core collection comprising 7 samples (1.57% of the total sample set) was constructed, efficiently capturing 99.74% of the genetic diversity within the dataset. Similarly, the core SNP set captured 9.91% of available SNPs, emphasizing its adequacy for breeding programs or conservation efforts, ensuring broad representation for further genotyping and phenotyping without redundancy.

### Conclusion

The genomic insights provided by this dataset offer valuable perspectives on the genetic landscape and population structure of wild rice. PCA and DAPC analyses elucidate the population stratification, while diversity metrics and genetic distances underscore the genetic richness and differentiation across groups. The selection sweep analysis highlights candidate regions for adaptive significance, providing a roadmap for future functional and evolutionary studies. The core collection demonstrates its value for practical applications by retaining extensive genetic variation while optimizing sample utility. This integrative approach confirms the feasibility and potential biological implications of targeted breeding and conservation initiatives based on the current genomic framework.
